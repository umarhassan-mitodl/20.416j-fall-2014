Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lecture / discussion: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

None.

Description
-----------

This course provides broad exposure to research in biophysics and physical biology, with emphasis on the critical evaluation of scientific literature. Weekly meetings include in-depth discussion of scientific literature led by various MIT faculty on active research topics. Each session also includes a brief discussion of non-research topics including effective presentation skills, writing papers and fellowship proposals, choosing scientific and technical research topics, time management, and scientific ethics.

Assignments
-----------

Reading questions on the weekly assigned paper are due at 9 AM before the corresponding discussion. Reading questions are answered via the course website, and should require only a few sentences each.

In addition, there will be a two-page research proposal due that will be followed by an in-class critique with your peers. While the research proposal will be modeled on the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) proposal, other fellowship programs are also acceptable.

Grading
-------

Grading is based on in-class participation, weekly reading questions, and the research proposal.
